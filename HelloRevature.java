/*
	Java compile to bytecode which is run within the Java Virtual Machine
	Virtual Machine: virtual machine is a walled-off operating system within an operating system
	Because we are running in the Java Virtual Machine, Java is what we call 
	"Write once, run anywhere"
	The JVM is independent of the operating system: so we can use Java the same way on Windows, Mac, Linux

	Automatic garbage collection
	
	Very safe, reusable
	
	Java is one of those things that's popular because it's popular
	(because Java has a very intense amount of standardization thanks to the JVM)

	The environment that Java exists in is consistent everywhere because of the JRE, JVM
