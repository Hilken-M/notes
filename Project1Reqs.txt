Project 1:
Likely due March 9th

You may use Java's collections implementations
Must be a REST api that employs a front-controller/MVC architecture
Must employ an ORM (hibernate, spring orm) instead of JDBC
Must implement CRUD (create-read-update-delete) functionality for database

Debating:
Must be deployed on an azure VM (depending on how fast I can get to this)
