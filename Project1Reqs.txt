Project 1:
Be prepared for any day Mark 8-10th

All
You may use Java's collections implementations
Must implement all CRUD (create-read-update-delete) functionality for database
Must include some form(s) of multiplicity
Some more complicated queries using either HQL or criteria API
    (for instance, going further than CRUD:
    aggregate queries, ordering, more intricate selects, etc)
Must be deployed on an azure VM (depending on how fast I can get to this)

Option 1
Must be a REST api that employs a front-controller/MVC architecture
Must employ an ORM (hibernate, spring orm) instead of JDBC

OR

Option 2 (harder)
You may use servlets to implement a front-end (you will have to learn html on your own)
While using Hibernate
