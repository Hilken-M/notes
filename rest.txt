REST?
Rest is one standard for communicating on the web:
it stands for Representation State Transfer
What are its doctrines?
    client-server architecture made of clients, servers, resources
    requests managed through HTTP

    stateless: meaning no client information is stored between requests, and
    each request is separate

    cacheable data

    uniform interface

        resources are indentifiable and separate from the representations sent to the client

        resources can be manipulate via the representation recieved because the representation contains
        enough data to do so

        descriptive messages returned to client have enough information to describe how client should process it

    that's most of the official definition from Red Hat -
    but for the most part, REST is about transferring data through JSON format

    what's JSON?
        Javascript object notation
            it really has little to do with javascript, but it is a convenient way to store objects
            for instance, a painting object:
            {
                painterID: #,
                title: "title",
                genre: "genre"
            }
    let's try it out... hope it works
